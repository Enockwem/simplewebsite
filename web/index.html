                        We set out to create top-notch ice cream, using the organic milk made on our farm in Nampuge, <br>
                        a little village hidden away amongst the gentle hills of Eastern Uganda. <br> We soon converted a little barn and from it, eagerly worked towards our goal; <br>
                        to make a family of ice creams that would be second to none in their taste and creamy texture. <br>
                        We soon converted a little barn into a shiny new facility and from it, <br> eagerly worked towards our goal; 
                        to make a family of ice creams that would be second to none in their taste and creamy texture.
                        Organic milk, <br>
                        fresh double cream and cane sugar all come together to craft the most delicious ice cream we think you’ll ever taste.
                        We’re obsessed with creating the most heavenly ice cream, <br> using the natural flavours of vanilla, dark chocolate, roasted nuts and fresh seasonal fruits.
