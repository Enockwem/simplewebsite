                    The proof of great ice cream is in the taste and our ice creams are only crafted from the very best fruit, berries, 
                    nuts and chocolate – all then mixed together with a huge helping of our very own creamy, organic milk. 
                    Enjoy our flavoursome range of gorgeous ice cream
                    Made right on the family farm in North Wales, 
                    using our own organic milk as the main ingredient, 
                    Kemi's Ice Cream is all about great flavour. Actually we’re obsessed with creating the perfect flavour, 
                    often working through the night at our kitchen table to combine all the fresh ingredients until we’re 100% happy with the results.
